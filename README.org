* Overview

projectile-git-autofetch is a minor mode for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] to automatically
fetch repositories you are currently working on (by default, all open
repositories known to projectile).

* Installation

To use this mode, add the repository to your load path, load it and
enable the minor mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/projectile-git-autofetch/")
(require 'projectile-git-autofetch)
(projectile-git-autofetch-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

For configuration options, please look at the customization group
~projectile-git-autofetch~. In particular,
~projectile-git-autofetch-projects~ lets you define, which
repositories to fetch (all repositories known to projectile, all open
repositories or only the repository for the current buffer).
